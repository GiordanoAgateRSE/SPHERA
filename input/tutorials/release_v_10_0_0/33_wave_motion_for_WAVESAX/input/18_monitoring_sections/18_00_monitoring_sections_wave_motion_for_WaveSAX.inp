##### section flow rate #####
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![?] Input parameters on monitoring sections for the flow rate. These sections 
!    must be convex non-degenerate quadrilaterals. Otherwise, the subroutine 
!    call for "point_inout_convex_non_degenerate_polygon" must be replaced with 
!    other calls (to subroutines such as "point_inout_quadrilateral").
![?] The whole section can be effectively modified at any restart time.
![?] <n_sect>: number of the flow rate monitoring sections
![?] <dt_out>: writing time step for flow rates. Contrarily to the other output 
!              timing quantities, this variable acts as a time filter because 
!              the flow rate is a mean quantity between two following writing 
!              time steps (the flow rate is not an instantaneous quantity). It 
!              should guarantee that no particle exits the domain before having 
!              be counted as a particle having possibly crossed any monitoring 
!              section.
![?] <n_fluid_types>: number of fluid types (the first fluid IDs are selected)
![?] Flow rates are averages between two following output time steps. They are 
!    not instantaneous values.
