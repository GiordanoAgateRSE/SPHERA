![?] 3D input parameters for the boundary faces of the fluid domain
![?] 3D boundary faces for wall frontiers, inlet/outlet sections, fluid 
!    reservoirs.
![?] In case of DB-SPH boundary treatment scheme, the code requires the faces of 
!    the parallelepiped domain as a "perimeter" and the "fictitious reservoirs".
![?] In case of SA-SPH boundary treatment scheme, the code requires the 
!    actual boundary faces.
![?] In case a fluid reservoir needs to be partitioned, then each partition 
!    needs a dedicated "perimeter" item.
![?] The last 1/2/3 vertex IDs are 0 in case of pentagonal / quadrilateral / 
!    triangular faces.
![?] SA-SPH boundary normal vectors and reservoir face normal vectors point 
!    inward the fluid domain: not the best convention (clockwise list of points 
!    if looking from outside the fluid domain).
![?] For "perimeter" boundaries: the vertices have to be adjacent, but there is 
!    no rule about the vertex order (better clockwise to keep coherence with 
!    SA-SPH walls).
![?] Faces can only be triangles or rectangles (generic quadrilaterals are not 
!    permitted). As an exception, "perimeter" faces can also be planar 
!    (i.e., non-skew) quadrilaterals, planar pentagons and planar hexagons.
![?] No gaps on face IDs are permitted
![?] <face_1_vertex_1>,...,<face_1_vertex_6>,<face_1_zone_ID>: first face 
!    data. The value "-1" is mandatory for meaningless vertex IDs (e.g., 5th 
!    and 6th vertices of a quadrilateral).
![?] <face_last_ID>,<face_last_vertex_1>,...,<face_last_vertex_6>,
!    <face_last_zone_ID>: last face data
![?] The first two vertices of an inlet section are the highest ones: their 
!    height is time-dependent in run-time.
