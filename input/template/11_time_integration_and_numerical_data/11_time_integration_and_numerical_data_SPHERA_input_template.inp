##### RUN PARAMETERS #####
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
![?] Input parameters for time integration, partial smoothing and memory 
!    management
![?] The run stops when reaching either the final time or the final time step; 
!    in case of a restarted simulation, these values are reported in the log 
!    file, but they are actually overwritten by the values read from the input 
!    restart file (these data have no influence in case of restart)
![?] <final_time>: its value can be effectively modified at any restart time.
![?] <final_time_step>: its value can be effectively modified at any restart 
!    time.
![?] <CFL>: its value can be effectively modified at any restart time.
![?] <vsc_coeff>: viscous stability condition coefficient; its value can be 
!    effectively modified at any restart time.
!    =0.05 (default value)
![?] <Leapfrog_flag>
!    =1 (Leapfrog time integration scheme)
!    =0 (explicit RK time integration schemes)
![?] <scheme_order>: time integration scheme order (but for Leapfrog is "1")
![?] <factor>: weighting factor to estimate dt (draft variable)
!    =0. (recommended value)
![?] <dt_alfa_Mon>: logical flag possibly making Monaghan artificial viscosity 
!    coefficient to influence dt; its value can be effectively modified at any 
!    restart time.
![?] <teta_p>, <teta_u>: coefficients for partial smoothing of pressure and 
!    velocity); their values can be effectively modified at any restart time.
!    <teta_p>=0.3+-0.1; <teta_u>=0
![?] <COEFNMAXPARTI>: max number of fluid particles max0 = COEFNMAXPARTI * 
!    nag; COEFNMAXPARTI considers that the number of particles inside the 
!    domain can be higher than the first assessment of the number of SPH 
!    particles (initial particles or reservoir particles; in case reservoir is 
!    derived from topography, COEFNMAXPARTI takes into account contributions 
!    from inlet sections and, in case of reservoir derived from topography, 
!    also the particles of the mixture dam/reservoir (beyond the main water 
!    reservoir). The way the restart file is read permits to change the input 
!    value of COEFNMAXPARTI in the input file of a restarted run. It is not 
!    necessary to run again the whole sequence of jobs. Its value can be 
!    effectively modified at any restart time.
![?] <COEFNMAXPARTJ>: max number of neighbours maxb = COEFNMAXPARTJ * (4h/dx)
!    ^ D; the same number applies both for fluid neighbours and DB-SPH wall 
!    element neighbours. Its value can be effectively modified at any restart 
!    time.
![?] <body_part_reorder>: for DB-SPH; its value can be effectively modified at 
!    any restart time. Its value can be effectively modified at any restart 
!    time.
!    =0 (fixed frontiers)
!    =1 (mobile frontiers)
![?] <ME_gradp_cons>: ID for the consistency/conservation of the 
!    pressure-gradient term in the momentum equation. Its value can be 
!    effectively modified at any restart time.
!    =-1 (conservative "grad_p + ALE term": 0th-order consistency + ALE term)
!    =3 (1st-order consistent + ALE term in the inner domain and at SASPH and 
!        body boundaries)
!    1st-order consistency options do not work in the presence of: dense 
!    granular flows; DBSPH boundaries; explicit RK time integration schemes.
!    1st-order consistency options activate the ALE corrective term in the 
!    continuity equation
![?] <CE_divu_cons>: ID for the consistency/conservation of the 
!    velocity-divergence term in the continuity equation. Its value can be 
!    effectively modified at any restart time.
!    =0 (0th-order consistency)
!    =1 (1st-order consistency)
!    1st-order consistency options do not work in the presence of: dense 
!    granular flows; DBSPH boundaries; explicit RK time integration schemes.
!    1st-order consistency options activate the ALE corrective term in the 
!    continuity equation 
![?] <C1_monitors>: ID for the consistency of the post-processing procedures 
!    at the monitoring elements
!    =.false. (0th-order consistency)
!    =.true. (1st-order consistency)
!    1st-order consistency options work also in the presence of: dense 
!    granular flows; DBSPH boundaries; explicit RK time integration schemes.

![?] if (3D) then
![?] <nag_aux>: rough overestimation of the number of fluid particles in the 
!    domain, it is only related to the very first allocation of the particle 
!    array, it is influential only in case of reservoir extruded from 
!    topography
![?] <MAXCLOSEBOUNDFACES>: max number of neighbouring boundary face per fluid 
!    particle; its value can be effectively modified at any restart time. 
!    Normally, this appreciably affects the total virtual memory, not the 
!    computational time.
![?] <MAXNUMCONVEXEDGES>: max number of edges; its value can be effectively 
!    modified at any restart time. Normally, it appreciably affects the total 
!    virtual memory, not the computational time.
![?] <GCBFVecDim>: rough overestimation of the number of Grid Cell - Boundary 
!    Face intersections  (SA-SPH). In case of restart, this value is only read, 
!    not used; in case its value is too little, crashes occur without code 
!    warnings/errors; "GCBFVecDim" only occupies 4B times the number of 
!    elements, thus, it is sufficient to overestimate this number as the number 
!    of faces times the number of the positioning grid cells, further, reducing 
!    "GCBFVecDim" does not imply any appreciable variation in the computational
!    time). The positioning grid is made of cubes whose side length is 2h. Its 
!    input value is read and then updated during the Initial Condition setting.
!    In case of restart, this quantity has to be read from the restart file.
